# Lib Module

This module contains utility functions and libraries used throughout the Transparencia Conectada platform.

## Structure

- `utils.ts` - Utility functions for common tasks

## Purpose

The lib module provides shared utility functions that are used across multiple parts of the application. These functions are typically pure functions that perform common operations like formatting, validation, or data transformation.

## Usage

Utility functions can be imported and used anywhere in the application where needed. They should be stateless and not depend on any component-specific logic.
