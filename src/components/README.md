# Components Module

This module contains all the reusable UI components for the Transparencia Conectada platform, built with ShadCN UI and Radix UI primitives.

## Structure

- `layout/` - Layout components (headers, footers, navigation)
- `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)

## Purpose

The components module provides a consistent and accessible user interface across the entire platform. All components are built with accessibility in mind and follow the design system established with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI.

## Usage

Components should be imported and used throughout the application to maintain consistency. Each component in the `ui/` directory is a customized ShadCN component that can be easily extended or modified.
