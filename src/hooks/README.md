# Hooks Module

This module contains custom React hooks used throughout the Transparencia Conectada platform.

## Structure

- `use-mobile.tsx` - Hook for detecting mobile device usage
- `use-toast.ts` - Hook for managing toast notifications

## Purpose

The hooks module provides reusable logic that can be shared across multiple components. Custom hooks encapsulate component logic to make it reusable and testable.

## Usage

Custom hooks can be imported and used in any functional component. They follow the React hook rules and conventions, and should be named with the `use` prefix.
